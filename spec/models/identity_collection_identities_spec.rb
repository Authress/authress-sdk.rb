#Authress

#<p> <h2>Authorization</h2> <p>Authorization for Authress is handled one of two different ways. Both mechanisms use oauth2 <i>Bearer</i> tokens.</p> <br> <h4>Identity Provider JWT</h4> <p>Hook up your preferred identity provider directly to Authress. Authress will verify JWTs sourced from that identify provider and allow direct integration with these APIs. Any OIDC JWT provider works, Google, Auth0, Okta, etc... With this mechanism your web app can make direct calls to the permissions API on behalf of your users. <br> <a href=\"https://authress.io/app/#/manage?focus=identity\">Link identity provider</a> </p>  <br> <h4>Authress Clients</h4> <p>Regardless of using direct identity provider integration, with the API you can create Authress clients which can call any of the methods on the API. Your users won't be able to directly make API calls, all web app integrations must go through a service which stores the Authress private key. <br> <a href=\"https://authress.io/app/#/manage?focus=clients\">Create Authress service client</a> </p>  <br> <h2>Usage</h2> <h4>Billable APIs</h4> <p>Most of the api available is completely free. Use it to populate your roles and configure your account. You'll only be charged for the ones marked as Billable.</p> <p><ul>   <li><i class=\"far fa-fw fa-money-bill-alt text-primary\"></i> <span class=\"text-primary\">Billable</span> - <small>These APIs count as calls for your account and will be charged.</small></li>   <li><i class=\"fas fa-fw fa-angle-double-right text-secondary\"></i> <span class=\"text-secondary\">Free</span> - <small>These are totally free.</small></li>   <li><i class=\"fas fa-fw fa-balance-scale text-secondary\"></i> <span class=\"text-secondary\">Condition</span> - <small>Are conditionally free, see api methods for details.</small></li> </ul></p>  <br> <h4>API Access</h4> <p>Access to the following APIs is based on Authress permissions, not the application permissions assigned in Authress to the application services. Each resource is tagged with the required permission <span class=\"badge badge-outline-secondary\">Action: Resource</span> </p>
